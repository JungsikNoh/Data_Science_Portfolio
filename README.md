# Data Science Portfolio - Jungsik Noh
This portfolio contains my data science projects for self-learning purposes.
It will be updated on a regular basis.

In this project I demonstrate the steps for building up a churn prediction model using a synthetic insurance customer dataset that mimic real-world dirty data.
An optimal model was searched for across logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, random forest, and decision tree models.

'nycflights13' is a relational database with airline on-time data for all flights departing NYC in 2013 as well as related tables of airlines, airports, planes and weather. In this notebook, I perform an exploratory and descriptive analysis mainly looking into how the departure delay time is related to other variables.

## Micro Projects

- [nycflights13 database file](https://github.com/JungsikNoh/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/MicroProjects/nycflights13.db)
  - A database (.db) file converted from an [R package nycflights13](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/index.html) that contains 
    a dataset of all flights departing NYC in 2013 together with related tables of airlines, airports, weather and planes.

- [Implementation of Apriori Algorithm in **Python**](MicroProjects/ImplementationAprioriAlgo.md)
  - Apriori algorithm is used for association rule learning and market basket analysis. 
    It finds frequent itemsets from large-scale transaction data recorded at the 
    point-of-sale (POS).
   
- [Implementation of Breadth First Search (BFS) and Girvan-Newman Algorithm for Graph analysis in **R**](https://rpubs.com/JungsikNoh/Implement_GirvanNewman_GraphAnalysis_R)
  - Girvan-Newman Algorithm is designed for community detection in a network.
   
- [Implementation of Reservoir Sampling Algorithm in **Java**](MicroProjects/Implementation_ReservoirSampling_Java.md)
  - To analyze rapidly arriving data streams where we cannot store all the data points, 
    effective sampling strategies become critical.
    Among those, Reservoir Sampling allows us to keep a sample with a fixed size, say $k$, at any given time, 
    even though the algorithm does not look back at previous data points. 
  
- [Implementation of Hierarchical Clustering (HCL) Algorithm in **R**](https://rpubs.com/JungsikNoh/ImplementHCLinR)
  - HCL is one of the most useful clustering algorithms. 
    It can also provide an order of data points based on their pairwise distances, 
    which is often useful for various data visualizations.

## Research Projects

published in 2021 at PLOS ONE ([**GitHub**](https://github.com/JungsikNoh/COVID19_Estimated-Size-of-Infectious-Population))

This study estimated actual daily numbers of COVID infections including unconfirmed or unreported cases. 
Its estimates of cumulative incidence were in line with the seroprevalence rates in 46 U.S. states sampled in 2020. 
The study estimated that the COVID cases in the U.S. were likely to be nearly four times more than the reported total cases as of Oct. 2020. 
It demonstrated that the regional severity of the COVID-19 pandemic had been misguided by the under-reported numbers of COVID infections.

A [**Medium article**](https://nohjssunny.medium.com/the-actual-highest-number-of-daily-covid-19-cases-in-the-us-is-estimated-to-be-about-400-000-in-e91bf1cce8e0) posted in 2020 explains what went wrong with the numbers of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide.

Its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JungsikNoh/COVID19_Estimated-Size-of-Infectious-Population) had reported daily estimates of COVID-19 cases from August 22, 2020 to October 7, 2022 on a daily or weekly basis.

The goal of this paper is to determine cause-effect relationships between protein activities that drive cell motion based on their activity time series extracted from microscopic videos of moving cells. 
I developed an innovative time series model and causal inference pipeline equipped with GUI to analyze tens of thousands of the local protein activity time courses.
